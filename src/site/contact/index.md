# Contact

This site is built and maintained by <a href="https://plus.google.com/117571249567635877826">+Chris Buckett</a>, 
who also runs the [dartwatch](http://blog.dartwatch.com) blog.  

To have your project added to this website, contact Chris Buckett, or make a pull request to this website's source, [over at Github](https://github.com/Dartwatch/builtwithdart.com).

### Contributing via Github

This website is built using a similar (but smaller) set of tools to the dartlang website, described on [Seth Ladd's blog](http://blog.sethladd.com/2012/07/how-we-built-dartlangorg.html).
At the minimum, you will need [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby based static site generator.  

To run the site locally:
1. Check out the code from github
2. Change into the `/src/site` folder
3. Run jekyll from the command line
4. Browse to http://localhost:8091 and you should see the site.

The static output generated by jekyll is deployed to google appengine.  You should normally not need to worry about this if you just want to see
what your pages look like.

### Creating a page for your project:

1. Create a folder in the relevant `/projects` subfolder, eg: `/projects/apps/awesome/`
2. Create an index.md file by copying the `/project/template.md` file, eg: `/projects/apps/awesome/index.md'
3. Edit the `_includes/header.html` file to add a link to your project on the menu, eg:  `<li><a href="/projects/apps/awesome/">RGB Cube</a></li>`
4. Add some screenshots or other images into your project's folder, eg: `/projects/apps/awesome/myapp.png`
5. Fill in the various fields in your `index.md` and add some text
6. Git Add, Commit and Push, then make a pull request on github.
(Contact me if you need help - I'm happy to do this if you send over some text and images!)

The `template.md` file looks like the following.  The part between the `---` forms the top part of the page, and injects some meta-data into the html.

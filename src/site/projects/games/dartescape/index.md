### Author's Notes

This game was developed with Flash/ActionScript and later ported to HTML5/Dart. 

The similarity between ActionScript and Dart made it surprisingly easy to convert the as3-files to dart-files. 

The [dartflash](/projects/frameworks/dartflash/) library provided the Display List, the Sound classes as well as the Resource class as a replacement 
for the embedded resources in the SWF file. Because of the similar languages and the compatible API the task was accomplished 
in only 6 hours. The most surprising outcome was the performance of the game in HTML5 - 
the game runs at smooth 60fps even on hardware where the Flash plugin is unable to deliver good performance.

### Author's Notes

This game was created during the 48-hour LudumDare programming contest. It was also the first thing I've ever written using Dart. I found the language to be very straightforward and (unlike Javascript) unsurprising. The learning curve was surprisingly shallow, and performance was great. The API was great and surprisingly complete for such a young language. I'm definitely going to keep using Dart for prototyping and web development.

### Author's Notes

This game gives an example of a setup for a HTML5 game. The game is written in Dart.

To improve performance, the level is buildup from tiles. Objects move from tile to tile, only the tiles that have changed are repainted each frame. 
Objects are pre-rendered on separate canvases.

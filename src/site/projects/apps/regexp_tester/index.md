## Author's notes

A simple regular expression tester built with Dart.

Given a regexp and a piece of text, application returns number of matches and highlights them with Dart logo's colors.

It's very simple, I made it just to show how easy is creating working applications for real-life purposes.


## Demo

Both **RegExp Tester** application and source code are hosted on GitHub.

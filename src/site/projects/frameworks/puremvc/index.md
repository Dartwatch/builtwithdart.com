### Author's Notes

PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic Model-View-Controller design meta-pattern. 

This is a Dart port of the AS3 reference implementation of the MultiCore Version. 
It supports modular programming through the use of Multiton Core actors.

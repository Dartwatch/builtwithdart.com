### Author's Notes

Buckshot is a UI Framework for modern web applications. It is written in Google Dart and attempts to model the best of .net WPF (Silverlight) and Adobe Flex, but without the need for a plug-in. Buckshot renders all output in HTML5/CSS3, and makes use of features available in today's modern web browsers.

If you've worked with .net WPF or Silverlight then this framework will feel very familiar to you.
